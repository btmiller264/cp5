Added custom user support and authentication. You can now only create teams and quarterfinal matchups if you are a logged in user. Also added support for adding the scores for quarter final matchups, with custom logic (comparing goals scored at first, and comparing away goals if goals scored is a tie) and a custom message that displays the outocme of the matchup.
