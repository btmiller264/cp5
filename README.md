Added custom user support and authentication. You can now only create teams and quarterfinal matchups if you are a logged in user, and the teams and matchups that show while logged in will be only the teams that user created. Also added support for adding the scores for quarter final matchups, with custom logic (comparing goals scored at first, and comparing away goals if goals scored is a tie) and a custom message that displays the outcome of the matchup.
